# code-refactor-challenge2

## Description

This project solves an issue to optimize accessibility for the Horiseon website, by improving its Search engine optimization. The project was built to make sure the elements of the source code follow a semantic logical structure & meet accessibility standards. Through the process of this project, I've learned how to clean up both html and css with semantic structure, how to edit/create a logical structure for html & css, and how to make sure attributes are added to ensure accessibility of the website.


## Usage

Please note that originally all work was committed and done on a separate repo of mine that was forked from an originating author for the class challenge. Unfortunately, I did not realize until the time of deployment that I did not have the correct permissions to deploy from a repo forked from the original repo, so I had to move all my completed work to this repo. 
Please reference https://github.com/jskelly8/code-refactor-challenge1 to see the original commits and changes that were done while I worked on this project.
